    <img src="images/mark-profile-picture.jpg" alt="Profile picture of Mark Rowley">
    <p>I am a computer science major, but actually have a passion for medicine. I plan to work in technological and medical research in the future. In my free time, I like to play games with friends, as well as write stories. I've recently began to get into worldbuilding as a hobby.</p>
    <p>I actually am really excited for this class because a lot of the editting I do for my hobby is on World Anvil, and they use HTML and CSS encoding in order to edit the various pages and customize content.</p>
    <p>As for family, I am single. I do have a wonderful brother and sister at home in Washington though. We all live with my parents, but at this time I am in Rexburg to complete my schooling.</p>
    <p>We've been members of the church all my life, and most of my parents lives as well. I served my mission in Vancouver, Washington, funny enough. It was an enlightening experience.</p>
